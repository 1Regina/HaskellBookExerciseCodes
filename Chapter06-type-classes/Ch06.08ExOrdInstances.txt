Anything with Ord class has implied Eq
Q1 -> works
  max (length [1,2,3]) (length [8, 9 , 10, 11, 12])
= max 3 5
= 5   

Q2 -> works bcos compare has Ord instance ie implied Eq instance
  compare (3 * 4) ( 3 * 5)
= compare 12 15
= LT

Q3 -> wont work. Cannot compare Bool with string as True is not of type [Char]
  compare "Julie" True

Q4 -> work bcos can order the results
  (5 + 3) > (3 + 6)
 = 8 > 9
 False
